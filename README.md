# AER_New_Software_Members
This is a temporary repository for helping the new members familiarize themselves with git and Arduino.

The two project files are:
- [[Project 1 - Familiarizing yourself with Git(hub)]]
- [[Project 2 - Interacting with Arduino]]

notes:
- I wrote these markdown documents using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download), so if the formatting doesn't look right on your machine I'd recommend downloading Obsidian and opening the [Github Repository](https://github.com/NicholasMDH/AER_New_Software_Members) as a new vault
- If you're having with either of these projects, feel free to reach out to me via Slack! While I want you guys to do these projects independently and work through them on your own, please reach out for help if you feel like you're at a dead end and don't know how to move forward.
