Steps:

1. Make sure you have joined the “controls-software” slack channel
2. Create a GitHub Account
	1. I would recommend using a non-school, professional-looking email address to create this account
		1. You can add more email addresses after this if you’d like, but make sure the primary email address is a professional, non-school address
	2. If I get any requests from funny-sounding email addresses, I will ask you to create a new account :)
3. Once you've created an account, send me a DM on slack with you full name, github username, and github email address
	1. Then you should come up to me so I can add them to the github project
4. Setting up environment
	1. All members of the software team will be interacting with github through WSL or a unix-based command line (mac/linux)
		1. For those running windows, follow [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) tutorial to install wsl
		2. Please just use the default installation steps, Ubuntu is very user-friendly and it will be easier if we are all working in the same environment
	3. Once you have wsl installed, create a “Project” folder in your windows filesystem (preferably in your C:\ or Documents folder)
	4. Then, back in WSL create a [symbolic link](https://www.howtogeek.com/287014/how-to-create-and-use-symbolic-links-aka-symlinks-on-linux/) to that folder in your home directory
	5. Once you have created your symbolically linked folder, navigate to it, and clone the github repository inside of it
5. Github Project
	1. Each new member will create a new Pull Request with its own NEW branch, and it will refer to the existing "# New Member Project #1" issue
		1. On repository website, navigate to "Pull Requests", and then select "New Pull Request"
		2. 
6. Working with github
	1. Don’t use “git add -a”, I am guilty of this, but it can add untracked files that are auto-generated by your development environment, which can then be difficult to remove once they’ve been committed
	2. I will be denying pull requests that include unnecessary files, I do not do this to hurt your feelings, I am only doing this to make sure we are only tracking source code
